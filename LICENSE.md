### Key Features of the MIT License

The MIT License is "permissive" because it places very few restrictions on what a user can do with the code. Here is a breakdown of what it allows and requires:

* **Commercial Use:** You can use the software for commercial purposes.
* **Modification:** You can change the code however you like.
* **Distribution:** You can share the original or modified code.
* **Sublicensing:** You can license the software to others under different terms.
* **Private Use:** You can use and modify the software privately without sharing changes.
* **The "One Rule":** You must include the original copyright notice and the license text in any copy or substantial portion of the software.

### Liability and Warranty

The section in **ALL CAPS** is the "disclaimer." It protects the author by stating that the software is provided "as is." If the software breaks something or doesn't work as expected, the author cannot be held legally responsible for damages.
